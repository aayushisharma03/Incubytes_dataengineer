# Problem Statement:
We have a comprehensive database for all our hospital customers, which includes a large number of users with membership cards. To enhance organization, I decided to separate the customers based on their country and create corresponding tables for each country. To facilitate this process, itâ€™s essential for our developers to understand the locations where customer data is stored. The extraction of this data will be handled by our source system, which will compile all relevant customer information and provide us with a data file.

# Methodology Used
I utilized two methods to achieve the stated objective. In the first method, I employed a CSV file as the source data, while in the second method, I utilized a Pandas dictionary to store the source data.
